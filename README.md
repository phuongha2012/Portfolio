# Natours - Website for a tour operator.

Check out the live site at: https://phuongha2012.github.io/Natours/, please adjust your screen width to see responsive effects.

The project is built in an advanced CSS course with deeper CSS experiment and SCSS implementation.

After this project, I am familiar with advanced CSS properties and SCSS concepts such as mixins, variables and functions and being able to create experience-enriching effects with CSS.
